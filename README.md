# Code-refactoring

Actively using semantic HTML, and reducing overall code to increase efficiency of the rendered website. This activity also improves the media accessibility user requirements.

## The challenge

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does). this code is for a marketing agency who wanted to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. The **Scout Rule** was also adhered to as I left the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
